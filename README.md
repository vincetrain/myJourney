==================
## What this project does
myJourney is a free-to-use personal diary that aims to bring ease in keeping a journal of days and events, and letting users freely express themselves within their Journey Books.
## Why this project is useful
myJourney lets users talk about their emotions and what happened during their days in a safe and encrypted zone. This helps put ease on one's mind as talking about one's mental health or emotions can "lift a weight off their chest". myJourney also provides quick access to mental health help services in case someone is in need.
## How we built this 
Using the environment provided by Qoom, we implemented HTML, CSS and JS to design the web application.
To store data, we resorted to using Google Firebase as it provided a very simple and intuitive noSQL database, letting us store photos, login credentials and more.
## Accomplishments that we are proud of 
During the development of this project, we were able to quickly learn and implement HTML, CSS and JavaScript into our website despite knowing little-to-none about these languages before.

We also were able to learn how to setup Google Firebase in web applications via CDN, where working with databases became a little more familiar to us.
## What is next for this project
We look forward to continuing development on this project by working on security, making it mobile-supported and polishing up the front-end design. Once we are happy with the front-end, and there are no security flaws, we plan to release this to the public under a custom domain.
